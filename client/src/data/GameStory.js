The landscape of skyscrapers and towering structures had been reduced to smoldering piles of rubble from the near daily earthquakes. You’ve scraped by on supplies from various looting runs, but everything seems to be running out. The time to journey east is now. You’ve been modifying an old ford to make the journey, welding on armor and siphoning what gas you can. Before the signal died out last year, you picked up a radio signal repeating the message “Washington D.C. is the last remaining safe zone. For anyone listening, if you can make it here, we can help you.” You could hit the road now, or make one last stop at old Pete’s and buy additional supplies.",
